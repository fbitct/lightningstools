Here's an example of how to use the BrowserWindowCaptureControl within a web page, to capture a screenshot of the browser itself 
(no other windows will be captured).  
-->
<html>
	<head>
		<title></title>
           <script type="text/javascript">
           //Captures an image of the browser window hosting this HTML document, 
           //and stores the results as a Base64-encoded string representation of a .PNG file 
           //and places the Base64-encoded string within a TextArea on this document

                   function captureBrowserWindow() 
                   {
                         captureControl.ImageFormat = "PNG"; //valid values are: EMF, EXIF, GIF, ICO, JPG, PNG,TIF, WMF, BMP
                         var windowCaptureAsBase64String= captureControl.CaptureBrowserWindow();
			             txtBase64.value = windowCaptureAsBase64String;
                   }
                </script>

	<!-- The Object tag below, instantiates an instance of the BrowserWindowCaptureControl, which can capture the browser window.

	    NOTE: The "codebase" attribute has not been set in this example, so this example code 
	    would not run on a machine on which the BrowserWindowCaptureControl had not been registered.
	    
	    To set the "codebase" attribute, you'd have to create an installer package for the BroswerWindowCaptureControl, 
	    (i.e., SETUP.EXE or xxx.MSI, etc, packaged into a .CAB file.), and then upload this .CAB file to an HTTP server somewhere, 
	    and then reference the HTTP location of the installer package .CAB file.
	    
	    For more info on packaging .NET ActiveX controls for deployment as .CAB files, see:
	    http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/CreateActiveXDotNet.aspx
	    
	    Note that the <object> tag only works in IE, also.  You have to use the <EMBED> tag for Mozilla/Firefox/etc. support.
